`Shwirl <https://github.com/macrocosme/shwirl>`_ is a custom standalone Python program to visualise
spectral data cubes with ray-tracing volume rendering. The program has been developed to investigate transfer functions
and graphics shaders as enablers for scientific visualisation of astronomical data. Details about the transfer functions
and shaders developed and implemented in **shwirl** can be found in a full length article by `Vohl, Fluke, Barnes &
Hassan (2017) <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/mnras/stx1676>`_.

**Disclaimer**: While the software is available for download and ready to visualise data,
this is not intended as a full software release just yet.
